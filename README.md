# Wildfire Monitoring — Portugal (ETL Workflow)

This repository contains an end-to-end workflow for **extracting, transforming, and loading (ETL)** Earth observation data to support wildfire monitoring and environmental analysis in Portugal.

The project integrates multiple geospatial datasets from **Google Earth Engine (GEE)** and **Meteostat** to generate per-tile environmental indicators (NDVI, soil moisture, brightness temperature, and local weather conditions).
